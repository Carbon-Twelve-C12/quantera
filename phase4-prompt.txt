Phase 4: Replace Mock Data with Real Backend Integration

Context: The Quantera platform authentication is now production-ready. However, the frontend currently uses ~90% mock/hardcoded data in portfolio, marketplace, and analytics components. Phase 4 replaces this with real backend API calls.

Objective: Systematically identify and replace all mock data in the frontend with real API calls to the Rust backend.

Step 1 - Discovery Phase:
1. Search the frontend codebase for common mock data patterns:
   - `const mockData =`
   - Hardcoded arrays of objects in component files
   - Comments mentioning "TODO", "mock", "placeholder", "hardcoded"
   - Large data structures defined directly in components

2. Create an inventory file `frontend-mock-data-inventory.md` listing:
   - File path
   - Component name
   - Type of mock data (portfolio holdings, market listings, analytics, etc.)
   - Estimated complexity (Low/Medium/High)

Step 2 - Backend API Verification:
1. Review `backend/src/api/secure_api.rs` to identify which endpoints already exist
2. Identify gaps where frontend needs data but backend has no endpoint
3. Document required new endpoints in `backend-api-gaps.md`

Step 3 - Priority Implementation (in this order):
1. Portfolio Data - Replace mock holdings with real user portfolio API calls
2. Marketplace Listings - Connect to real asset listings from backend
3. Analytics/Charts - Replace mock time-series data with real metrics
4. User Settings - Connect profile/preferences to backend

Constraints:
- Do NOT implement missing backend endpoints yet - only document them
- Focus on connecting to EXISTING backend APIs first
- Add proper error handling and loading states
- Maintain TypeScript type safety
- Keep existing UI/UX unchanged - only swap data sources

Deliverables:
1. `frontend-mock-data-inventory.md` - Complete inventory of mock data
2. `backend-api-gaps.md` - List of needed but missing backend endpoints
3. Modified frontend components with real API integration where backend supports it
4. No changes to backend in this phase

Ask questions if you find ambiguous data flows or unclear component responsibilities. Do not assume - diagnose first.
