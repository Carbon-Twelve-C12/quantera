# Cloudflare MCP Server Integration Guide for Cursor

## âœ… Setup Complete!

I've successfully configured your Cursor MCP settings to include the Cloudflare MCP servers. Here's what has been set up:

### 1. **Installed MCP Servers**

The following Cloudflare MCP servers are now configured in your `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

- **cloudflare-bindings**: Workers applications with storage, AI, and compute primitives
- **cloudflare-builds**: Insights and management for Cloudflare Workers Builds
- **cloudflare-docs**: Up-to-date Cloudflare reference documentation
- **cloudflare-observability**: Debug and insight into application logs and analytics
- **cloudflare-dns-analytics**: DNS performance optimization and debugging

### 2. **Next Steps to Activate**

1. **Restart Cursor**
   - Close Cursor completely
   - Reopen Cursor to load the new MCP configuration

2. **Create Cloudflare API Token**
   - Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
   - Click "Create Token"
   - Use "Custom token" template
   - Add these permissions:
     ```
     Account permissions:
     - Cloudflare Pages:Edit
     - Cloudflare Workers Scripts:Edit
     - Analytics:Read
     - Workers Builds Configuration:Read
     
     Zone permissions (if using custom domain):
     - DNS:Read
     - Page Rules:Read
     ```
   - Click "Continue to summary" â†’ "Create Token"
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

3. **Configure API Token in Cursor**
   When you use any Cloudflare MCP command, Cursor will prompt you for the API token.
   Store it securely when prompted.

### 3. **How to Use in Cursor**

Once activated, you can use natural language commands like:

#### For Deployment:
- "Help me deploy my React frontend to Cloudflare Pages"
- "Create a Pages project for my Quantera platform"
- "What's the correct build configuration for my React app?"
- "Set up environment variables for my deployment"

#### For Monitoring:
- "Show me the build logs for my latest deployment"
- "Why is my Cloudflare Pages deployment failing?"
- "Check the status of my Workers builds"
- "Show me analytics for my deployed application"

#### For Debugging:
- "Debug the 404 errors on my Cloudflare Pages site"
- "Help me configure the correct routing for my React SPA"
- "Show me recent errors in my application logs"

#### For Documentation:
- "What's the difference between Workers and Pages?"
- "How do I configure custom domains on Cloudflare?"
- "Show me best practices for React apps on Cloudflare"

### 4. **Specific to Your Quantera Deployment**

Based on your project structure, here are specific commands you can use:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - "Create a new Cloudflare Pages project named 'quantera' for my React frontend"
   - "Configure build settings with command 'cd frontend && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build' and output directory 'frontend/build'"

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - "Set up REACT_APP_API_URL environment variable pointing to my backend API"
   - "Configure production environment variables for my Pages deployment"

3. **Custom Domain**:
   - "Help me set up quantera.finance as my custom domain"
   - "Configure DNS records for my custom domain"

4. **Monitoring**:
   - "Show me real-time logs for my Quantera application"
   - "Check Web Analytics for user traffic patterns"

### 5. **Troubleshooting Tips**

If MCP servers don't appear in Cursor:
1. Make sure you've completely restarted Cursor
2. Check that `mcp-remote` is installed: `npm list -g mcp-remote`
3. Verify the JSON syntax in `~/.cursor/mcp.json` is valid
4. Try running: `npx mcp-remote https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse` manually to test
