7. [ ] Expand backend services to support new contracts
8. [ ] Update frontend to integrate new features

## Timeline

Based on our progress, we are currently in Week 7-8 of our Implementation Plan. We've completed the core contract implementations and interfaces, as well as advanced platform features like multi-asset support, liquidity solutions, and yield optimization.

The next major milestone is expanding the backend services to support these new contracts and integrating them into the frontend. This should take about 2-3 weeks. After that, we'll focus on comprehensive testing and deployment preparation.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Multi-Asset Architecture**: Ensuring our architecture remains flexible for any asset class
2. **Liquidity Model Complexity**: Implementing concentrated liquidity requires careful mathematical modeling
3. **Yield Strategy Safety**: Ensuring yield strategies are secure and perform as expected
4. **Cross-Chain Integration**: Managing data consistency across multiple blockchains
5. **User Experience**: Making complex financial products accessible to users
6. **Gas Optimization**: Efficiently managing gas costs for complex operations
7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adapting to global regulatory frameworks

## Next Meeting Agenda

1. Review implementation progress on AssetFactory, LiquidityPools, and YieldOptimizer
2. Discuss backend service expansion for new features
3. Plan API enhancement for new contracts
4. Review frontend integration approach
5. Discuss testing strategy for new components
6. Update timeline and priorities
