## Next Steps

### Backend Implementation
1. Complete the backend services
   - Implement ComplianceClient
   - Implement TradingClient
   - Implement L2Client

2. Implement additional service layers
   - YieldSchedulerService
   - UserService
   - Authentication service

3. Implement API layer with Warp
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Request validation and error handling

### Frontend Implementation
1. Complete React application
   - Navigation and routing
   - State management with Context API
   - Wallet connection
   - Smart account management

2. Implement additional pages
   - Trading interface
   - Portfolio management
   - Compliance verification dashboard
   - Institutional validator panel

3. Implement API integration
   - Fetch real data from backend APIs
   - Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Add error handling and loading states

### Testing
1. Complete unit testing for all contracts
   - Test L2Bridge contract
   - Test SmartAccountTemplates contract
   - Test interaction between contracts
2. Implement integration tests for backend services
3. Implement end-to-end tests for the complete system

### Documentation
1. Complete API documentation
2. Create user guides
3. Create developer documentation
4. Prepare deployment documentation

## Current Priorities

1. Implement ComplianceClient for backend contract interaction
2. Implement remaining backend client classes (TradingClient, L2Client)
3. Create API layer for frontend communication
4. Expand the frontend with additional pages and wallet connectivity
5. Implement comprehensive test suites

## Timeline

Based on our progress, we are currently in Week 3 of Phase 1. We've completed all core contract implementations including the L2Bridge contract with blob data optimization (EIP-7691) and SmartAccountTemplates contract with various templates. We've also implemented key backend components including the TreasuryTokenClient for interacting with token contracts. The next steps should be completed within the next 2 weeks to stay on track with the implementation plan.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Pectra Integration**: Ensuring compatibility with Ethereum's Pectra upgrade features (EIP-7702, EIP-7691, EIP-2537)
2. **L2 Integration**: Design and implementation of the L2 bridge needs careful testing
3. **Compliance**: Regulatory compliance mechanisms need thorough verification
4. **Security**: All smart contracts must undergo careful security review
5. **Frontend UX**: The trading interface needs to be intuitive despite complex underlying mechanics
6. **Smart Account Templates**: Ensuring the templates are secure, efficient, and user-friendly
7. **Backend Client Interoperability**: Ensuring all backend clients work together seamlessly

## Next Meeting Agenda

1. Review current contract implementations including the newly added L2Bridge and SmartAccountTemplates
2. Review the TreasuryTokenClient implementation and integration
3. Discuss remaining backend client implementation strategy
4. Review API design for frontend communication
5. Plan security audit
6. Update timeline and priorities
