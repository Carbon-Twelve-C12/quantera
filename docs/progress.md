   - [ ] RESTful API endpoints
   - [ ] Authentication and authorization
   - [ ] Request validation and error handling

### Frontend Implementation
1. Complete React application
   - [ ] Navigation and routing
   - [ ] State management with Context API
   - [ ] Wallet connection
   - [ ] Smart account management

2. Implement additional pages
   - [ ] Trading interface
   - [ ] Portfolio management
   - [ ] Compliance verification dashboard
   - [ ] Institutional validator panel

3. Implement API integration
   - [ ] Fetch real data from backend APIs
   - [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
   - [ ] Add error handling and loading states

### Testing
1. Complete unit testing for all contracts
   - [ ] Test L2Bridge contract
   - [ ] Test SmartAccountTemplates contract
   - [ ] Test interaction between contracts
2. Implement integration tests for backend services
3. Implement end-to-end tests for the complete system

### Documentation
1. Complete API documentation
2. Create user guides
3. Create developer documentation
4. Prepare deployment documentation

## Current Priorities

1. ✅ Implement ComplianceClient for backend contract interaction
2. ✅ Implement remaining backend client classes (TradingClient, L2Client)
3. ✅ Implement service layer components (YieldSchedulerService, UserService, AuthenticationService)
4. [ ] Create API layer for frontend communication
5. [ ] Expand the frontend with additional pages and wallet connectivity
6. [ ] Implement comprehensive test suites

## Timeline

Based on our progress, we are currently in Week 4 of Phase 1. We've completed all core contract implementations, backend client implementations, and the service layer. The next steps are to implement the API layer and frontend components, which should be completed in the next 2-3 weeks according to the implementation plan.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Pectra Integration**: Ensuring compatibility with Ethereum's Pectra upgrade features (EIP-7702, EIP-7691, EIP-2537)
2. **L2 Integration**: Design and implementation of the L2 bridge needs careful testing
3. **Compliance**: Regulatory compliance mechanisms need thorough verification
4. **Security**: All smart contracts must undergo careful security review
5. **Frontend UX**: The trading interface needs to be intuitive despite complex underlying mechanics
6. **Smart Account Templates**: Ensuring the templates are secure, efficient, and user-friendly
7. **Service Layer Performance**: Ensuring the service layer can handle the expected load and scale as needed
8. **Authentication Security**: Implementing secure authentication mechanisms and token management

## Next Meeting Agenda

1. Review the newly implemented service layer components (YieldSchedulerService, UserService, AuthenticationService)
2. Discuss API layer design and implementation plan
3. Review frontend requirements and architecture
4. Plan API integration with frontend components
5. Plan security audit for service layer and API
6. Update timeline and priorities
