## Timeline

Based on the implementation plan, we are currently in Week 1 of Phase 1, focusing on project setup and core contract implementation. The next immediate steps should be completed within the next 1-2 weeks to stay on track with the implementation plan.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Integration with Pectra**: Ensure compatibility with Ethereum's Pectra upgrade features (EIP-7702, EIP-7691, EIP-2537)
2. **L2 Integration**: Design a seamless experience across L1 and L2 networks
3. **Compliance**: Ensure regulatory compliance while maintaining user experience
4. **Security**: Implement robust security measures for smart contracts and user accounts
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of smart contracts and blockchain interactions

## Next Meeting Agenda

1. Review completed smart contract implementations
2. Discuss backend service architecture
3. Plan frontend component structure and design
4. Address any blockers or challenges
5. Update timeline and priorities
