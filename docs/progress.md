## Timeline

Based on our progress, we are currently in Week 6 of Phase 1. We've completed all core contract implementations, backend client implementations, service layer components, and the API layer. We've made significant progress on the frontend components, including responsive design and theme system implementation. The next priorities are wallet connectivity and API integration, which should be completed in the next 1-2 weeks according to the implementation plan.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Pectra Integration**: Ensuring compatibility with Ethereum's Pectra upgrade features (EIP-7702, EIP-7691, EIP-2537)
2. **L2 Integration**: Design and implementation of the L2 bridge needs careful testing
3. **Compliance**: Regulatory compliance mechanisms need thorough verification
4. **Security**: All smart contracts must undergo careful security review
5. **Frontend UX**: The trading interface needs to be intuitive despite complex underlying mechanics
6. **Smart Account Templates**: Ensuring the templates are secure, efficient, and user-friendly
7. **Service Layer Performance**: Ensuring the service layer can handle the expected load and scale as needed
8. **Authentication Security**: Implementing secure authentication mechanisms and token management
9. **API Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation for API endpoints
10. **Accessibility**: Ensuring the application is accessible to users with disabilities
11. **Theme Consistency**: Maintaining visual consistency across components in different themes

## Next Meeting Agenda

1. Review the newly implemented UI components and theme system
2. Discuss wallet integration approach
3. Plan API integration with frontend components
4. Discuss authentication flow for frontend
5. Plan security audit for API and frontend
6. Update timeline and priorities
