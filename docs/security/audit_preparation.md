# Quantera Platform Security Audit Preparation

## Overview
This document outlines the preparation for the security audit of the Quantera Platform's smart contracts and related systems. It defines the scope, critical components, known risk areas, and specific considerations for auditors. This preparation guide aims to facilitate a thorough and efficient security audit process.

## Audit Scope

### Smart Contracts
1. **Asset Tokenization**
   - TreasuryRegistry.sol
   - TreasuryToken.sol
   - ComplianceModule.sol
   - AssetFactory.sol

2. **Liquidity and Trading**
   - LiquidityPools.sol
   - TradingModule.sol
   - YieldOptimizer.sol

3. **Cross-Chain Functionality**
   - L2Bridge.sol
   - L2BridgeGasOptimizer.sol

4. **Smart Account Management**
   - SmartAccountTemplates.sol

### Integration Points
1. Asset-Liquidity interactions
2. Cross-contract calls between core contracts
3. L2Bridge messaging security
4. Smart account deployment and operations

## Critical Components and Risk Areas

### 1. AssetFactory Contract
- **Risk**: The multi-asset tokenization system has complex permission logic and interactions.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Asset creation permissions
  - Parameter validation for different asset classes
  - Template security
  - Custom asset field validation

### 2. LiquidityPools Contract
- **Risk**: The concentrated liquidity positions involve complex mathematical calculations that could have edge cases.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Price calculation accuracy
  - Integer overflow in liquidity math
  - Slippage protection
  - Tick manipulation attacks
  - Fee calculation and collection

### 3. YieldOptimizer Contract
- **Risk**: Auto-compounding and yield strategy application involve third-party protocol interactions.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Strategy security isolation
  - Yield calculation accuracy
  - External contract interaction safety
  - Privilege escalation vectors

### 4. L2Bridge Contract
- **Risk**: Cross-chain messaging is inherently complex and susceptible to replay and data manipulation attacks.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Message authentication
  - Replay protection
  - EIP-7691 blob data handling
  - Gas optimization safety
  - Transaction ordering dependencies

### 5. SmartAccountTemplates Contract
- **Risk**: Template-based account deployment could introduce risks if the template contains vulnerabilities.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Template validation
  - Account deployment security
  - Privileged operations
  - Delegate security

## Common Vulnerability Categories to Check

### 1. Access Control
- Proper implementation of ownership mechanisms
- Role-based access control implementation
- Function visibility and modifiers
- Check for missing access controls on critical functions

### 2. Asset Management
- Token transfer security
- Approval mechanisms
- Fee collection and distribution
- Asset lifecycle management (creation, maturity, retirement)

### 3. Mathematical Correctness
- Price calculations in LiquidityPools
- Yield accrual in YieldOptimizer
- Fee calculations
- Slippage protection

### 4. State Management
- Reentrancy protection
- Check-Effects-Interactions pattern usage
- Front-running protection
- Transaction ordering dependencies

### 5. External Interactions
- Safe handling of external calls
- Proper error handling
- Handling of failed calls
- Contract existence checks

### 6. Gas Optimization
- Gas-optimized code without security compromises
- Efficient storage usage
- L2 bridge gas optimizations
- Blob data handling efficiency

## Testing and Verification

### Existing Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all contracts (>85% coverage)
- Integration tests for contract interactions
- Special tests for mathematical edge cases
- Gas consumption benchmarks

### Additional Tests Needed
- Fuzzing tests for mathematical functions
- Symbolic execution for critical functions
- Formal verification of core liquidity math
- Cross-chain message verification tests

## Specific Audit Requests

1. **AssetFactory and LiquidityPools Integration**
   - Review the integration test we created to verify all edge cases are covered
   - Validate that the asset lifecycle events are properly handled in the liquidity pools

2. **L2Bridge Security**
   - Special attention to message authentication and validation
   - Review of data compression algorithms for security implications
   - Verify handling of different L2 chain characteristics
   - EIP-7691 blob data implementation security

3. **Smart Account Template Security**
   - Verify template validation logic
   - Check for potential injection vectors in template creation
   - Review delegate management security

4. **YieldOptimizer Strategy Security**
   - Review strategy isolation mechanisms
   - Validate yield calculation formulas
   - Check for potential strategy manipulation vectors

## Environment Setup for Auditors

### Development Environment
- Node.js v18 or newer
- Hardhat development framework
- Rust (stable version 1.70.0 or newer) for backend tests
- Alloy.rs framework with Pectra EIP support

### Running Tests
```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run unit tests
npx hardhat test

# Run integration tests
cd tests/contracts
./runIntegrationTests.sh

# Run specific tests
npx hardhat test tests/contracts/integration/AssetFactoryLiquidityIntegrationTest.js
```

### Code Organization
- `contracts/` - Main smart contract directory
  - `factories/` - AssetFactory and related contracts
  - `liquidity/` - LiquidityPools and related contracts
  - `yield/` - YieldOptimizer and strategies
  - `l2/` - L2Bridge and cross-chain functionality
  - `accounts/` - Smart account templates
  - `interfaces/` - Contract interfaces

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **L2Bridge Gas Optimization**
   - The gas optimization routines are aggressive and may require additional safety checks
   - Blob data compression could potentially affect message integrity if not properly validated

2. **Liquidity Pool Tick Spacing**
   - Current tick spacing implementation may have edge cases around tick boundaries
   - Price range logic needs thorough verification

3. **Yield Strategy Risk Isolation**
   - Strategy compartmentalization needs verification to ensure one strategy cannot affect others

4. **Environmental Asset Verification**
   - Current implementation relies on external verifiers which introduces trust assumptions

## Recent Changes to Review

1. Enhanced integration testing between AssetFactory and LiquidityPools
2. Improved cross-contract behavior during asset lifecycle events
3. Optimized L2Bridge gas consumption with EIP-7691 blob support
4. Enhanced YieldOptimizer strategy marketplace with trust minimization
5. Updated TreasuryToken with support for automated yield distribution
