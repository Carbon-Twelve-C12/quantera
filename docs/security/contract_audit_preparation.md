## Focus Areas for Audit

### 1. Smart Account Security
- **Template Verification**: Ensure template verification process is robust
- **Delegation Mechanism**: Verify delegation permissions are properly enforced
- **Execution Sandboxing**: Confirm execution is properly sandboxed to prevent unauthorized actions
- **Nonce Management**: Validate nonce handling to prevent replay attacks

### 2. L2 Bridge Security
- **Cross-Chain Message Integrity**: Ensure messages cannot be tampered with
- **Blob Data Handling**: Verify blob data is correctly processed and secured
- **Compression Algorithm Safety**: Confirm compression algorithms don't introduce vulnerabilities
- **Message Replay Protection**: Validate measures to prevent message replay across chains

### 3. Asset Management
- **Multi-Asset Security**: Ensure different asset types are properly segregated
- **Access Control**: Verify role-based access control is correctly implemented
- **Price Oracle Integration**: Confirm price oracles are secure and manipulation-resistant
- **Upgrade Mechanisms**: Validate upgrade patterns don't introduce security risks

## Potential Edge Cases

### SmartAccountTemplates.sol
1. **Template Execution with Malicious Parameters**
   - An attacker might attempt to provide malicious parameters to a template execution
   - **Mitigation**: Implement parameter validation and bounds checking

2. **Delegate Permission Escalation**
   - A delegate might attempt to execute functions beyond their permissions
   - **Mitigation**: Strict permission checks and proper delegate role management

3. **Template Versioning Conflicts**
   - Updating templates might break compatibility with existing accounts
   - **Mitigation**: Version tracking and compatibility checks

### L2Bridge.sol
1. **Cross-Chain Message Failure**
   - Messages might fail to process on the destination chain
   - **Mitigation**: Implement retry mechanisms and failure handling

2. **Gas Price Volatility**
   - Extreme gas price changes might make bridging uneconomical
   - **Mitigation**: Dynamic gas pricing and thresholds

3. **Chain Reorganizations**
   - Block reorganizations might affect message confirmation
   - **Mitigation**: Wait for sufficient confirmations before finalizing

### L2BridgeGasOptimizer.sol
1. **Compression Dictionary Manipulation**
   - An attacker might attempt to manipulate the compression dictionary
   - **Mitigation**: Strict access control on dictionary updates

2. **Decompression Bomb**
   - Crafted compressed data might expand to consume excessive resources
   - **Mitigation**: Size limits and resource consumption caps

3. **Blob Size Miscalculation**
   - Incorrect blob size calculation might lead to transaction failures
   - **Mitigation**: Buffer calculations and conservative estimates

## Key Security Properties to Verify

### Access Control
- All privileged operations require appropriate roles
- Role management functions are properly secured
- Emergency pause mechanisms function correctly

### Data Integrity
- State changes maintain data consistency
- Critical operations use appropriate validation

### Economic Security
- Fee mechanisms are properly implemented
- Economic incentives are aligned with security goals
- Value transfer functions prevent unauthorized withdrawals

### Cryptographic Security
- Signature verification is correctly implemented
- BLS operations follow best practices
- Random number generation is secure and unpredictable

## Test Vectors for Audit Team

### SmartAccountTemplates.sol
- Deploy template with maximum-sized code
- Execute account with complex nested operations
- Test delegate permissions with various permission combinations
- Attempt execution after template updates

### L2Bridge.sol
- Bridge orders with maximum message size

- Test blob vs. calldata decisions at threshold boundaries

## Known Issues and Mitigations

1. **Storage Layout Optimization**
   - We recently optimized storage layout in SmartAccountTemplates.sol
   - Need verification that the optimization doesn't introduce state inconsistencies

2. **L2Bridge Message Consolidation**
   - Refactored message handling to reduce redundancy
   - Need verification that the consolidation preserves all security properties

3. **Compression Algorithm Efficiency**
   - Improved compression efficiency in L2BridgeGasOptimizer.sol
   - Need verification that optimization doesn't sacrifice security

## Audit Scope Prioritization

1. **High Priority**
