## First Priority: L2Bridge Gas Optimization ✓

The first contract to focus on is the L2Bridge contract, due to its critical role in cross-chain operations and the potential for significant gas savings with EIP-7691 blob data optimization. Specific tasks include:

1. ✓ Refactor message encoding to use more efficient formats
2. ✓ Implement specialized encoding for blob data
3. ✓ Optimize storage layout for message tracking
4. ✓ Improve compression algorithm efficiency
5. ✓ Reduce redundant operations in message processing
6. ✓ Implement batched message handling

These optimizations have been implemented, with the goal of reducing the gas cost of cross-chain operations by at least 15-20%.

## Next Priority: LiquidityPools Gas Optimization

Having completed the L2Bridge optimizations, the next contract to optimize is the LiquidityPools contract, focusing on:

1. Optimize tick bitmap operations
2. Reduce storage reads in price calculations
3. Use more efficient math for liquidity calculations
4. Cache frequently accessed values
5. Implement storage packing for position data

These optimizations will aim to reduce gas costs for liquidity provision and swapping operations.
