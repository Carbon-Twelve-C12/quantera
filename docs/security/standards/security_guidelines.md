## Introduction

The Quantera Platform handles significant financial assets and critical operations. Security is therefore of paramount importance. This document outlines the security standards that must be followed by all smart contracts in the platform.

## Error Handling

### Custom Errors

All contracts should use custom errors instead of revert strings for gas efficiency and better error handling:

```solidity
// Bad - uses string revert
require(amount > 0, "Amount must be positive");

// Good - uses custom error
error InvalidAmount(uint256 amount);
if (amount == 0) {
    revert InvalidAmount(0);
}
```

### Benefits of Custom Errors

- Gas efficiency: Custom errors use significantly less gas than string error messages
- Better error information: Custom errors can include parameters for more detailed error context
- Better developer experience: Custom errors are easier to understand and handle in testing

### Standardized Error Types

The following standard error types should be used across contracts:

1. `Unauthorized(address caller, bytes32 requiredRole)` - For access control violations
2. `InvalidParameter(string paramName, string reason)` - For invalid parameter inputs
3. `InvalidZeroAddress(string paramName)` - For zero address checks
4. `ArrayLengthMismatch(uint256 length1, uint256 length2)` - For array length validation
5. `EmptyInput(string paramName)` - For empty string or array validation

## Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control

All contracts should use OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for role management:

```solidity
// Define roles as constants
bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant OPERATOR_ROLE = keccak256("OPERATOR_ROLE");

// Use role-based checks
function sensitiveOperation() external {
    if (!hasRole(OPERATOR_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
        revert Unauthorized(msg.sender, OPERATOR_ROLE);
    }
    // Perform operation
}
```

### Role Management Best Practices

1. Always use explicit role checks with custom errors for authorization
2. Group related roles together in the contract for better readability
3. Document all roles and their purposes in contract comments
4. Use granular roles to apply the principle of least privilege
5. Implement two-step role transfers for critical roles

## Input Validation

### Validation Standards

All public and external functions should validate their inputs at the beginning of the function:

1. Check for zero addresses where addresses are used
2. Validate numeric ranges (non-zero, max limits, etc.)
3. Ensure strings and arrays are not empty when required
4. Validate array lengths match when multiple arrays are used together
5. Check that values sum to expected totals (e.g., percentages sum to 100%)

### Example:

```solidity
function updateAsset(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 fee) external {
    // Zero address check
    if (asset == address(0)) {
        revert InvalidZeroAddress("asset");
    }
    
    // Range validation
    if (amount == 0) {
        revert InvalidAmount(0);
    }
    
    // Maximum limit check
    if (fee > MAX_FEE) {
        revert FeeTooHigh(fee, MAX_FEE);
    }
    
    // Implementation...
}
```

## Control Flow Patterns

### Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern

All functions should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern:

1. **Checks**: Validate all inputs and preconditions first
2. **Effects**: Update contract state
3. **Interactions**: Make external calls to other contracts last

### Example:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    // Checks
    if (amount == 0) {
        revert InvalidAmount(0);
    }
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) {
        revert InsufficientBalance(msg.sender, amount, balances[msg.sender]);
    }
    
    // Effects
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    totalSupply -= amount;
    
    // Interactions
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    if (!success) {
        revert TransferFailed();
    }
    
    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

## Gas Optimization

### Storage Optimization

1. Use `uint128`, `uint64`, or smaller types when possible
2. Group smaller variables together to pack into a single storage slot
3. Use `constant` for fixed values rather than storage variables
4. Use events for data that doesn't need to be accessed on-chain
5. Use memory instead of storage when possible

### Example:

```solidity
// Bad - uses multiple storage slots
uint256 public startDate;
uint256 public endDate;
bool public isActive;
bool public isPublic;

// Good - packs into a single storage slot
struct ConfigData {
    uint64 startDate;
    uint64 endDate;
    bool isActive;
    bool isPublic;
}
ConfigData public config;
```

## Reentrancy Protection

### Standards

1. Use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard for all functions that make external calls
2. Use the nonReentrant modifier on all functions that:
   - Transfer ETH
   - Call external contracts
   - Transfer tokens
   - Update critical state that could be exploited if called reentrantly

### Example:

```solidity
function executeSwap(address token, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    // Implementation with external calls
}
```

## Token Safety

### ERC20 Token Handling

1. Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 for all ERC20 token operations
2. Always check return values of token transfers
3. Use `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` instead of direct transfers

### Example:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

contract TokenHandler {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
    
    function withdrawTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external {
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

## Sensitive Operations

### Two-Step Process for Critical Changes

Implement a two-step process for sensitive operations:

1. Owner/admin proposes a change
2. Change is applied after a timelock period or confirmation

### Example:

```solidity
address public pendingNewOwner;
uint256 public ownershipTransferTimestamp;
uint256 public constant OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_DELAY = 2 days;

function proposeNewOwner(address newOwner) external onlyOwner {
    pendingNewOwner = newOwner;
    ownershipTransferTimestamp = block.timestamp + OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_DELAY;
    emit OwnershipTransferProposed(msg.sender, newOwner, ownershipTransferTimestamp);
}

function acceptOwnership() external {
    if (msg.sender != pendingNewOwner) {
        revert NotPendingOwner(msg.sender);
    }
    if (block.timestamp < ownershipTransferTimestamp) {
        revert TransferDelayNotMet(block.timestamp, ownershipTransferTimestamp);
    }
    
    address oldOwner = owner();
    _transferOwnership(pendingNewOwner);
    pendingNewOwner = address(0);
    emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, msg.sender);
}
```

## External Calls

### Safe External Call Patterns

1. Always validate return values from external calls
2. Use try/catch for calls that might fail
3. Implement fallback mechanisms for critical operations
4. Avoid depending on external call success for critical state changes

### Example:

```solidity
function safeExternalCall(address target, bytes memory data) internal returns (bool, bytes memory) {
    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = target.call(data);
    return (success, returnData);
}
```

These guidelines should be followed for all new contract development and updates to existing contracts. Regular security audits will verify compliance with these standards.

## Audit Requirements

All major contracts should undergo:

1. Automated analysis with tools like Slither, Mythril, and Echidna
2. Internal security review against these guidelines
3. External audit by a reputable security firm
4. Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
