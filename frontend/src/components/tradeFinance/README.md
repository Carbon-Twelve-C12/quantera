# Trade Finance Module for Quantera Platform

## Overview

The Trade Finance module extends Quantera's capabilities to support tokenized trade finance instruments, including letters of credit, invoice receivables, warehouse receipts, bills of lading, and supply chain finance. This implementation aligns with the vision for democratizing access to these assets through fractional ownership and blockchain-based settlement.

2. **Real-time Liquidity**: Settlement occurs in seconds rather than days or weeks as in traditional systems.
3. **Transparent Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard showing market metrics, risk distribution, and geographic exposure.
4. **Digital Identity Verification**: Support for robust KYC/AML and specialized business entity verification.
5. **Asset Type Flexibility**: Supports multiple trade finance instrument types with appropriate visualizations.
